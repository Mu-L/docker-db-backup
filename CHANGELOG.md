This is the fourth major release to the DB Backup image which started as a basic MySQL backup service in early 2017. With each major release brings enhancements, bugfixes, removals along with breaking changes and this one is no different.

This release brings functionality requested by the community such as multiple host backup support by means of independent scheduler tasks,blackout periods, better resource usage, better security via file encryption, file permissions, and more verbosity via log files. , and also merges contributions from other developers.

Upgrading to this image should for the most part work for most users, but will involve event upgrading environment variables as the formathas changed significantly. Old variables should continue to work, however are unsupported and will be removed with the `4.3.0` release, whenever that will be.

A significant amount of development hours were put in to accomodate for feature requests by the community.
